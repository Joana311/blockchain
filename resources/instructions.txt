Blockchain technology is a very promising innovation. While ideas of digital
cash have existed decades before, Bitcoin was the first implementation that
was able to address all issues previous systems had. A key building block of
blockchain networks is the ability for a completely decentralized network of peers
to reach consensus. One of many consensus algorithms, also used by Bitcoin is
proof of work.

The goal of this project is to implement a fully working blockchain with very
basic algorithms for peer discovery, block propagation, and a simple consensus
protocol. Usually, proof of work is the easiest to implement. However, other
consensus algorithms such as practical Byzantine fault tolerance or Paxos are
welcome. The blockchain must be able to process transactions into blocks and
protect against double spend attacks using a UTXO transaction model.

Optimization is not key. Hence, implementation specific tasks will be easier.
The protocol does not have to be efficient and using JSON or any other structured
data format is encouraged. Additionally, using java built in crypto utility
functions for creating public-private key pairs are sufficient. Hashing must be
based on SHA256.

For bootstrapping a test-net, docker containers should be used. The net-
work protocol must be fault tolerant handling disconnects and reconnects. For
simplification a trusted setup can be used, where a trusted node is used to boot
up the network.
